## Take it

You did a PR and you need to ammend it? It's easy, just update your files and execute `take-it`

It will add all the current modifications, ammend the previous commit and push it to the repo.

It won't work on **master** branch

## Link it

When you need to add something to your path `link-it [full-path]`

It will check if there isn't already a symlink, if it doesn't exist it will create a link to the specified path
